            <p class="secSubtag para-small">
                Wildlife Conservation can be defined as preventing wildlife from uneven killing and poaching. It also involves the practice of making people aware by telling them about the importance of wildlife. Wildlife Conservation is very important to maintain the food chain and ecosystem balance. If all the tigers get hunted for skins, then the count of deers increases drastically. Along with this, if humans kill all the hens for meat, then there would be no source of eggs. So, Wildlife conservation is necessary to maintain the population of animals on Earth to maintain their role in the ecosystem and food chain.

                Endangered species are essential for biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p class="secSubtag para-small">
                We can think of biodiversity as nature’s balancing act, where all the world’s species work together to keep populations in check and protect our planet’s ecosystems. When certain species become endangered or extinct, that balance is upset, causing ripples throughout the rest of the world’s species.

                Take bees as an example. These insects play a crucial role in pollinating plants, helping maintain biodiversity and ensuring the availability of fruits, vegetables, and nuts in our ecosystems.

                <br>With globally declining numbers of bee populations, including some species such as the Potter Flower Bee and the Cliff Mason Bee becoming regionally extinct, there is a concern that there will be significant consequences for food security and ecosystem health.

                Indicators of environmental health
            </p>
            <p class="secSubtag para-small">
                Endangered species can also serve as indicators of environmental health. When populations decline, it can signify underlying issues such as habitat destruction, pollution, or climate change, which, if unaddressed, can threaten the stability of the entire ecosystem and many other species.

                For example, declining populations of bald eagles in North America allowed scientists to discover that the environment had been contaminated with DDT, a pesticide used to control mosquitoes and other insects. In this way, the bald eagle served as a warning sign for the environmental damage being done by DDT, allowing a ban on the chemical to be put in place and eagle populations to recover along with the environment.
